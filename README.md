experiment with browser haptics and user interaction.

i wanted to mash different objects and forms of interactions into one sensory fidget toy experience, and used motionJS to animate a button-ball-joystick-pet object that users can physically interact with.

to bring the experience to life and improve the sensory appeal of the fidget toy, i implemented browser-based web haptics using the navigation API. however, ios doesn't allow browser-based haptics and i do not own an android device... please let me know if it works on android :-)
